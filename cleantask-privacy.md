# Privacy Policy for Clean Task — Minimal To-Do
Last updated: February 21, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how Clean Task — Minimal To-Do ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App") for Android devices.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect
We do not collect, store, or process any personal information from you when you use the App. Specifically:
- No account registration or login is required, so we do not collect usernames, emails, or passwords.
- No cloud synchronization features are included, so all your task data (text content of to-do items) is stored **only on your local device** and never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.
- We do not collect device identifiers (such as IMEI, phone number, MAC address, or serial number).
- We do not collect usage data (such as app launch frequency, task creation history, or interaction logs).
- We do not collect location data, camera access, or microphone access.

## 2. Local Data Storage
All task data you create (e.g., task text, completion status) is stored locally on your device's internal storage. You have full control over this data:
- You can delete individual tasks by swiping left on the task item.
- You can clear all tasks via the "Clear All Tasks" option in the App's Settings menu.
- Uninstalling the App will permanently delete all local task data from your device.

## 3. Permissions
The App requests minimal permissions only to support basic functionality, and we do not use these permissions to collect or share personal data:
### 3.1 READ_PHONE_STATE
This permission is added by the App's development framework (uni-app) by default. **We do not use this permission to access any phone state information (including IMEI, phone number, network status, or device identifiers)**. This permission is not used in any functional logic of the App and does not impact your privacy.

### 3.2 WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
These permissions are included for potential local file access (the App does not currently use these permissions to read/write external files or collect any file-related data).

### 3.3 EXPAND_STATUS_BAR
This permission is used to support basic UI interactions and does not access any personal data.

## 4. Dark/Light Mode (System Follow)
The App supports automatic switching between dark mode and light mode, which follows your device's system display settings:
- The App only accesses your device's **system display mode preference** (dark/light) locally on your device to adjust the App's UI style.
- This system preference data is not collected, stored, or transmitted to our servers or any third parties.
- You can manually override the system setting in the App's Settings menu if needed, and this choice is also stored only on your local device.

## 5. Third-Party Services
We do not integrate any third-party services (such as analytics tools, advertising SDKs, or social media plugins) into the App. This means:
- No third parties have access to your data.
- No data is shared with advertisers, analytics providers, or other external entities.

## 6. Children's Privacy
The App is suitable for users of all ages and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
